### Hi there 👋

<!--
**JadeGuz/JadeGuz** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
The product manager would complete the user interview and ask detailed questions in regards to functionality as well as allow the user to provide a visual and build
on those visions to ask further questions. What will the user be using this for? What are your end goals, or what would you want certain functions to do? Is there a 
specific group of people that this software will be created for or anyone in general? What value will this software bring?

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
It takes the user ideas and breaks it down for the rest of the team to prioritize. It provides the functionalities that will be needed and by looking at how easy or
how hard the task is they are able to set a deadline and distribute work accordingly.

How do I approach developing programs? 
Understanding thoroughly the framework being used and taking as much feedback as possible. Learning from your mistakes and knowledge transfer

What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Keeping a very detailed backlog is important in order to prioritize tasks more effectively and it is something I plan to incorporate into my future development of
work since boards can become clogged with inactionable feedback and keeping a detailed and organized backlog will keeps the team focused on the task at hand.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates effectively with the rest of the team on any issues they may be having that might impede them from
getting a task completed. A good team member also ensures that they attend all meetings, as well as completes their portion of their 
work. In addition, a good team member offers to help if needed by another team member.
